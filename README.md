# Guardrail 🛡️

**Protect your execution. Stop the idea-hop.**

Guardrail is a minimalist validation and focus tool designed to help founders and builders stop jumping between projects. It enforces discipline by scoring ideas objectively and locking your focus for the week.

---

## 🧘 What it is
- **A filter for your brain**: A place to dump ideas and score them against a rigorous 10-point validation framework.
- **A commitment device**: A weekly lock that prevents you from switching projects mid-week.
- **A progress log**: A simple way to document daily wins and aggregate resources automatically.

## 🚫 What it is NOT
- **A project management tool**: No kanban boards, no complex task nesting, no "to-do" lists.
- **A collaborator platform**: Built specifically for the solo builder or the individual lead.
- **A general note-taker**: Notes are secondary to "Logs" and "Scores."

## 🗓️ Weekly Workflow

Guardrail is designed to be used in a specific, calm rhythm:

### 1. The Monday Commitment
Every Monday (or when you start your week), review your **Idea Backlog**.
- Select one **Primary Focus**.
- Select one **Secondary Focus**.
- **The Lock**: Once you click "Set as Weekly Focus," these ideas are locked. You cannot remove them or swap them until Sunday at 11:59 PM.

### 2. Daily Execution
Throughout the week, your only job is execution.
- Open your active Focus card.
- Use **"Log Progress"** to record what you did.
- Add links, images, or documents. These are automatically extracted into your **Resources** tab.

### 3. The Sunday Reset
On Sunday night, the timer expires. 
- Review your logs.
- Decide if the idea is a **GO** (keep executing next week), **MODIFY** (pivoting), or **DROP** (validated as a 'no').
- Clear your focus and prepare for the next Monday.
